        <h3>Jubilee Austin | Portfolio</h3>
		    <p>The Jubilee Austin Portfolio was my first website project ever! I completed it in December of 2019 after taking one online course on Skillcrush. It is a mock-up portfolio design that showcases clean and semantic HTML5 and CSS. For this project, we learned the basics of important HTML elements to add structure and content. We then implemented the CSS we learned to style the webpage and give it a modern asthetic. This project is where I discovered my passion for writing code. I guess you could say it was love at first site....</p>

        <h3>Rogue Pickings | Website</h3>
        <p>Rogue Pickings is a website that I made for my second website project on Skillcrush. For this lesson, we were simply given the design comp to pull from. The rest was hand coded from HTML5 and CSS. This project taught me how to utilize Adobe Photoshop to pull fonts, images and colors from a design comp provided by a client. My favorite part of this website was learning how to create sections in a different way than the Jubilee project.</p>

        <h3>South Court | Website</h3>
        <p>My third project is a work in progress website for a local historical neighborhood association. I love being involved in my local community as much as I love writing code and developing beautiful websites. As an active member in the South Court Historical neighborhood association, I jumped at the chance to create the website for our local community. I am having a blast utilizing the new skills im learning to add to it as I learn to implement more stacks.</p>
